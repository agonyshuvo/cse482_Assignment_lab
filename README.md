<b>Assignment: </b>
Construct a basic portfolio website of your own. The webpage should have your photo, career objective, working experience (if any, place dummy if none) and skills. Use external CSS script. Your page must support mobile view and desktop view as well. That means the page must be fully responsive, not part should be broken if display is changed.
